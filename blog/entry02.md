i found some hardware technologies that can store memory for a really long time by searching up "long term storage"
5d memory crystals (also known as superman memory crystal)
+ has a temperature resistance of 1000 degrees celsius
+ holds 300 tb of data (a lot as of now)
+ lasts 10^20 years
- expensive (as of now)

dna storage
+can store a lot of stuff
- costs a lot of money (3.5k$ per 1mb of data)
- read only (i cant use it as ram :( )

+ used by arctic world archives
+ will last thousands of years
-is not publicly available


edp (and skills)
i learned how to research effiecently and ask questions about my research when i look up methods of storing data for a long time, even if they were kinda silly, for example, i wondered if i could run the game doom off using dna as ram.
