## Researching for the Topic
For context, the topic I chose is visual arts for the Freedom Project, and we had to research hardware and software for that topic in tech.
### What I found
While researching, I managed to find interesting information about my topic, as there are many different tyeps of software and hardware soley for art. Some software I found for art are:
* [Procreate](https://www.procreate.com), a famous drawing app that is available for iPad users/iOS
* [Autodesk Sketchbook](https://www.sketchbook.com/), another drawing app that is available for all different software (iOS, Windows, etc.) and so on and so forth.

The software I found, they were mostly drawing apps, all with different functions and prices. However, that makes sense, as an artist's main goal, specifically digital artists, is to draw, so it makes sense for these apps to be mostly drawing apps. But, they also need specific hardware in order to achieve their goals. Here is the hardware I manage to find:
* [Best Drawing Tablets 2023 - Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/article/best-drawing-tablets/?sh=44ea6f913cb2), an article made by Forbes, which goes into detail about what specific art tablets you can use to make your drawing experience better
* [Buying Guide: Essential Tools for Digital Artists](https://paperlike.com/blogs/paperlikers-insights/digital-artist-buying-guide), article made by the screen-protector brand, Paperlike, and it goes into detail about what types of hardware is recommended to artists, like tablets, styluses, and so on and so forth.
