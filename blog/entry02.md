i learned how to research effiecently and ask questions about my research when i look up methods of storing data for a long time, even if they were kinda silly, for example, i wondered if i could run the game doom off using dna as ram. some of the things i found were:
5d memory crystals (also known as superman memory crystals)
+ has a temperature resistance of 1000 degrees celsius
+ holds 300 tb of data (a lot as of now)
+ lasts 10^20 years
- expensive (as of now)
