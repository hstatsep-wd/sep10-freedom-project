## Gathering Information
For context, the topic I chose is visual arts for the Freedom Project, and we had to research hardware and software for that topic in tech.
### What I found
While researching, I managed to find interesting information about my topic, as there are many different tyeps of software and hardware soley for art. Some software I found for art are:
* [Procreate](https://www.procreate.com), a famous drawing app that is available for iPad users/iOS
* [Autodesk Sketchbook](https://www.sketchbook.com/), another drawing app that is available for all different software (iOS, Windows, etc.) and so on and so forth.

The software I found, they were mostly drawing apps, all with different functions and prices. However, that makes sense, as an artist's main goal, specifically digital artists, is to draw, so it makes sense for these apps to be mostly drawing apps. But, they also need specific hardware in order to achieve their goals. Here is the hardware I manage to find:
* [Best Drawing Tablets 2023 - Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/article/best-drawing-tablets/?sh=44ea6f913cb2), an article made by Forbes, which goes into detail about what specific art tablets you can use to make your drawing experience better
* [Buying Guide: Essential Tools for Digital Artists](https://paperlike.com/blogs/paperlikers-insights/digital-artist-buying-guide), article made by the screen-protector brand, Paperlike, and it goes into detail about what types of hardware is recommended to artists, like tablets, styluses, and so on and so forth.

### How I found it
I had to do some deep searching through the internet in order to find reliable articles and websites for my research. There were many websites that weren't related to what I wanted, and there were websites that were untrustworthy and unprofessional. However, I realized that sometimes, just looking at the product's website itself can be the answer, which is how I managed to get to the specifics. With the articles though, it took some time and patience, but I managed to get enough information for my Freedom Project topic, which I'm grateful for. 

## EDP
I am now on step 2 of the Engineering Design Progress, which is researching for the problem that I'm working on. My problem is that people aren't aware of the possible usages of tech in art, as well as learning our limits with the combination of technology and art. I had to research about the software and hardware of art in order to go into step 3 at some time, which is brainstorming possible solutions. Personally, I think that will be hard, but I will try my best in the future.

## Skills I learned
Of course, along with the google searching, I managed to learn some skills along the way. Here are two of them.
### Proper Google Searching
One of the skills I learned while researching was learning how to google properly. When I was searching, I realized that I wasn't getting enough information I wanted at first. It was frustrating to have to keep on scrolling to look for the right sources. So, I decided to constantly use different search terms instead, making each one more specific as I go on. It helped tremendously, as I managed to get the right resources for my research, so it all worked out at the end. I will definitely use this skill more often if I want to research something.

### Identifying Proper Resources
Another skill I learned is identifying proper resources to use. When it comes to surfing through the internet, you are bound to come across shady websites and unreliable sources. So, with the skills I already learned a while back, I managed to deduct the most trustworthy websites to use by identifying if the website is good, if there are any authors, if it looks professional, and etc. Thanks to that, I managed to get more information in the process. Also, now I can identify which websites are reliable or not, thanks to this skill I learned.

## What Comes Next?
Well, I'm looking forward to the next steps in my Freedom Project soon. The more I do this, the more I come to love art and coding. This is fun!
