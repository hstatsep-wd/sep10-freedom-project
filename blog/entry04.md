### css grid
I used the css grid to do some things like organizing pages. I personally think it would go well with bootstrap. one of the ways i messed with it was that I messed around with the size of the boxes among with the colors of the boxes.

### Jquery
I used jquery to make a checklist of things to do, and then when i click on something it removes it from the list. i think this would put a little bit of spice to my freedom project project.

### Jekyll
Jekyll is usefull because i can host a server with it, and i managed to do that. however i lost the code to it and cannot find it.
