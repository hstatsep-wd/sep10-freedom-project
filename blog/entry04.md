## Tinkering with Tools
For context, as the time of making this blog entry, I am choosing a tool to stick with for my Freedom Project, as it helps us make our websites more cooler.

### The tool I chose
We were presented with a variety amount of tools to choose from for our Freedom Project. They vary by level of difficulty it is to use and learn it, from *pretty easy* to learn to **very hard**. When I decided to choose my tool, I decided to go with one of the more harder ones to learn, jQuery. jQuery is an html tool that uses JavaScript in order to make it functional. It helps with adding cool tricks with your website, like making things disappear and move, for example. I thought that was cool, so I put that as my first choice. I had two backups though, Aframe and SASS, just in case I didn't want to do jQuery.

After choosing it, I decided to tinker around with it for a while, to learn more about it. I decided to utilize [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), to teach me all about jQuery and the other tools, and [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/), to help me with doing my own experimentations with the tool. Both sites were very useful, as they both made learning jQuery more *easier and faster* for me to get it, along with my other tools. Here is one of the times I tinkered:

### My Final Choice
Of course, after all my experimentation, it all came down to finally choosing my final tool that I will be using for the rest of the year and Freedom Project. After all the tinkering with my tool, my final decision is to actually keep with my first choice, jQuery. It is because after all the tinkering and learning, I realize how jQuery is the right one for me. I was a bit nervous about it at first, due to it being a relatively hard tool to use and learn, and the fact that we have to **stick** with that one tool for our entire Freedom Project. But, I realized later on that jQuery is actually not that hard once you get the hang of it. So, after all of that, I am sticking to jQuery from now on.
## Skills
While learning about my tool, I ended up learning a lot of skills along the way, especially considering how I'm learning an entirely new topic by myself. So, here are the two skills I learned while tinkering with my tool.
### Trying New Things
One thing I learned while learning how to use jQuery is trying new things isn't too bad. Since jQuery is one of the more relatively harder ones, I was a bit cautious on trying it out, especially knowing the fact that it's JavaScript. However, after tinkering with the other tools, such as Aframe for example, I realized how jQuery was the right one for me, as I felt like it fit my website well. I had to experiment with new tools in the process of choosing what I wanted, and I didn't regret it. It was a good choice for me, as jQuery was my first choice and I stuck with it, though it took a while to get to that point. Now I know that it is **necessary** to try new things to get what you like.

### Experimentation
Another skill I learned was how to experiment with things properly, as I was learning a new tool to use completely on my own. Especially since that tool is something that's relatively *hard*. So, with all the resources I had, such as [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/) and [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), as they are the most reliable for me. I ended up doing a lot of tinkering in order to understand jQuery well, and it ended up working quite well thanks to it. Tinkering helped me realize jQuery is more easier than I thought. I will keep this skill in mind, as experimentation is a good skill to have for things other than SEP.

## What Comes Next
Well, I'm just looking forward to learning more about my tool, and doing more of my freedom project later on. I bet it'll be fun!
