## Compiling All My Information
For context, my topic for the Freedom Project is art, and as of the date of this blog, I am finished with both Part A and Part B of my Project. Here's how I did it.

### Finishing Part B
After we were done with Part A of the Freedom Project, which was researching for it, we had to use all the information we had gathered to make up ideas of future technology of the topic we did. For me that was the **hardest** part, as making up new ideas was hard. 

### Organizing All the Info
After finishing both parts, all I had to do was organize them all together for it to be in one document.

## EDP (Engineering Design Process)
I am now on step 3 of the Engineering Design Process of my Project, which is brainstorming possible solutions to my problem. My problem is people aren't aware of the potential of digital art, and how digital artists can unlock a lot of potential if new technology for it is available, which will lead me to transition into step 4, which is plan the most promising solution. It will take some time, but I will get there at some point.

## Skills I learned
Of course, when it comes to actually finishing this part of the Freedom Project, I am *bound* to learn some things along the way. Here are two skills I learned while doing this part of my Freedom Project.

### Organizing Information
The first skill I learned was organizing all my information together in a nice way. When I first did Part A and B, both were already somewhat organized when I stared them, as they were compilied by what components they are, like by software and hardware for example. However, when we actually had to combine the information together into one doc, I quickly realized how organizing them in my orginal way **wouldn't work**. So, I decided to reorganize them to make it more appealing, and it ended up working. I am quite grateful now that I learned this skill.

### Being More Creative
The second skill I learned was being more creative when it comes to making new ideas for something, especially if those ideas are supposed to be very big ideas. When I first came up with ideas for future technology in digital art, it was pretty hard, as coming up ideas for something that is completly new is very **hard**. The first ideas I came up with are decent at a surface level, it's just that they aren't *new* enough. So, I took the criticism, and decided to start over. I ended up managing to make even better ideas, though it took some thinking. Now, I am even more satisfied with what I had done.

## What Comes Next?
Well, next is learning more about the other topics in SEP10, and doing more of my Freedom Project. Either way, it'll be exciting to do! I look forward to the future of this class.
