#part b

I brainstormed Part b by thinking about what made previous technologies work and the properties of them (for example, the record on voyager 1 will last billions of years because its coated in uranium, and it has gold for the disc because gold doesn't corrode) and them I used concepts of technologies from today to make a new technology that would last a long time, and would hold enough information.
