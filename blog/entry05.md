## Learning My Tool
For context, as I'm making this blog entry, I am currently learning about the tool I chose to use for my Freedom Project website, as it helps us make our websites more fun and interactive to use in the future of making them.

### The Tool I Chose
In the previous blog entry, I said that I chose jQuery because I thought it would work best for my FP website, plus I thought it was the best for me to learn, as I wanted to try out a bit of Javascript before hand. I ended up tinkering with it *a bit* before hand in order to see if I liked it, and I did. So, that means I have to be dedicated to learning all about jQuery for the rest of the year for my Freedom Project, as it is **mandatory** to use at least one tool for your website, so that is why I stuck with jQuery.

### Trying It Out
After firmly selecting jQyery as my tool, we were all given a lot of time to learn all about our tool by ourselves to see how it works and how we are able to utilize it on our websites we are going to make in the future. I ended up learning a lot about jQuery along the way, most notably thanks to [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jquERy/default.asp), which is a great resource for learning anything about coding websites. I ended up learning a lot more about jQuery thanks to that website, like making certain elements disappear, doing animation, changing the `css`, and much more.

I ended up doing all the tinkering in jsbin, which is a also a great source for learning the basics of `html`
