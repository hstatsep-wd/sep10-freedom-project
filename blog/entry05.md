# what i learned and how i learned
I learned that jquery is just javasrcipt, which is something I am familliar with, which I enjoyed using in the past due to the versitility that it provides.
I already knew some javascript in the past, so using Jquery was pretty easy for me to grasp and get the hang of.

# what I made
I tried making something for my freedom project, which is about the preservation of information. the way izidemonstrated this was by making a simulation of a punchcard. i made a script that uses a bunch of checkbox elements that add a value in binary that adds up to 127 (which means its 7 bit). in retrospect, my code is very shoddy and I could have done many many things to make it more efficient and make it less like a giant ball of spaghetti and make it more organized. 


```
$('#1').change(function() {
  if ($(this).is(':checked')) {
    $("span").text(i += 1);
    $('.idk').text(String.fromCodePoint(i));
  } else {
	$("span").text(i -= 1);
    $('.idk').text(String.fromCodePoint(i));
  }
});
```
a segment of my code shows how it works, where it checks if a box with a class is on or off, and changes the value of ```i``` accordingly to how it would work in binary. binary basically works like a chain of light switches that turn on and off which mathmatically add up to any number due to the next value being double the value before it. for example ```1111``` would mean 15 because 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15. this is essientally how all digital information works.

# summary
overall my code is very very shoddy but it gets the job done and it works how I intended it to work, which overall means I did good.
