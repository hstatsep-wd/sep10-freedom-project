# Jquery practice

# what i learned and how i learned
I learned that jquery is just javasrcipt, which is something I am familliar with, which I enjoyed using in the past due to the versitility that it provides.
I already knew some javascript in the past, so using Jquery was pretty easy for me to grasp and get the hang of.

# what I made
I tried making something for my freedom project, which is about the preservation of information. the way izidemonstrated this was by making a simulation of a punchcard. i made a script that uses a bunch of checkbox elements that add a value in binary that adds up to 127 (which means its 7 bit). in retrospect, my code is very shoddy and I could have done many many things to make it more efficient and make it less like a giant ball of spaghetti and make it more organized.
