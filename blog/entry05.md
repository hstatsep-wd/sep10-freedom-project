## Learning My Tool
For context, as I'm making this blog entry, I am currently learning about the tool I chose to use for my Freedom Project website, as it helps us make our websites more fun and interactive to use in the future of making them.

### The Tool I Chose
In the previous blog entry, I said that I chose jQuery because I thought it would work best for my FP website, plus I thought it was the best for me to learn, as I wanted to try out a bit of Javascript before hand. I ended up tinkering with it *a bit* before hand in order to see if I liked it, and I did. So, that means I have to be dedicated to learning all about jQuery for the rest of the year for my Freedom Project, as it is **mandatory** to use at least one tool for your website, so that is why I stuck with jQuery.

### Trying It Out
After firmly selecting jQyery as my tool, we were all given a lot of time to learn all about our tool by ourselves to see how it works and how we are able to utilize it on our websites we are going to make in the future. I ended up learning a lot about jQuery along the way, most notably thanks to [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jquERy/default.asp), which is a great resource for learning anything about coding websites. I ended up learning a lot more about jQuery thanks to that website, like making certain elements disappear, doing animation, changing the `css`, and much more.

I ended up doing all the tinkering in [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/?html,output), which is a also a great source for learning the basics of `html` and tinkering with new elements and things you learned. I ended up testing out a lot of things about jQuery onto here, like different types of effects, functions, speeds, and much more. Some of the jsbin tinkerings I did are available on this [link](https://jsbin.com/tuvamigaki/1/edit?html,output), [here](https://jsbin.com/naxodiperi/edit?html,css,output), and [there](https://jsbin.com/huyecabuda/edit?html,output). I did a lot more too, which was good for me getting how jQuery functions as a tool.

Overall, I managed to learn **a lot** about jQuery as a whole thanks to actually learning about it on my own, and this is all going to be quite helpful when it comes to actually using the tool when we have to put it in our Freedom Project.

## Skills
As time went on, I ended up learning and adapting a lot of more skills to use for learning about my tool and the Freedom Project, so here are two of them.

### Willingly Learning New Things
One skill I ended up discovering was the usage to learn new things. Due to me being focused for learning my tool as it is *quite* important to learn for the Freedom Project, I ended up knowing a lot more than I thought about jQuery thanks to learning a lot more about it. I realized as time went on, **the more** I was willing to learn, **the more** I actually ended up knowing. Since you are able to go at your own pace, I ended up being relaxed while learning my tool, and I actually ended up enjoying learning about my tool. Which is a good thing, since I have to use it at the end for my Freedom Project. I will definetly use this skill more often in the future.

### Doing Things by Yourself
Another skill I ended up utlizing was learning and doing things by yourself. This skill made me realize that learning aobut my tool isn't too bad after all, as I'm going through at my own pace and at my own process, instead of following someone or have someone guide my way. While that is good, learning by yourself helps you with making sure that you have chosen the right path, and that you can do your own little things and tinker with things about the tool without having anyone else criticize you and just go at your own flow. I will utilize this skill elsewhere whenever I can, as it can help me significantly with progressing in other things.

And what comes next? Well, I guess I have to start learning more and more about my tool and start to really focus on my Freedom Project, as it isn't too far away in the time being. I'll look forward to it.
