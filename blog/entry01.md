# Entry 1 Deciding on My Topic
##### 10/23/23

## Chosing a Topic
The topic I'm choosing for my Freedom Project is Arts/Crafts. It is because I've always had a passion for the arts ever since I was little, spefically visual arts, and I plan to have a career in the arts in the future, maybe even getting that involved in technology too! Not only do I love drawing and sketching, I also like to explore in more art mediums, such as digital art, painting, and crafting. So having this project as an opportunity to keep on exploring my passion for school is great, as this combines what I love the most with something I am enjoying learning currently! (_Which is HTML/CSS of course_)

While exploring for the topic, I ended up encountering a lot of interesting websites and articles along the way, making me fall into a rabbit hole of exploration of the arts. There were many websites that relate to art and technology, such as AI art generators and social media websites such as DeviantArt and Pinterest. But the websites that stuck out to me the most and were the most relevant to my research were the articles [The Serious Relationship of Art and Technology](https://www.widewalls.ch/magazine/the-serious-relationship-of-art-and-technology) by Widewalls and [Coding == Art](https://medium.com/@mauralian/coding-art-312efa2020fd) by Medium. These two articles showed my a lot more about art and technology combined and they go more in depth about how important the relation is. Another article I explored was [Art and Technology: How Technology is Changing the Art World](https://www.pinotspalette.com/naperville/blog/creative-life/-pinotspalettenaperville-art-and-technology-how-technology-is-changing-the-art-world#:~:text=Digital%20art%20uses%20digital%20technology,projectors%2C%20and%20other%20digital%20platforms.) by Pinots Palette, which states what specific art mediums use technology now. I also found out about an art studio, [Breakfast Studio](https://breakfaststudio.com/) who incorprate technology in the art itself, and how they do it, which is very fascinating to see. Overall, all of these websites helped me go more in depth of understanding the relationship between art and technology.

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
As of this blog entry, I'm on the first step of the Engineering Design Process, which is Defining the _Problem_. The problem I am plaaning to solve in my project is __the rise of AI art and how can artists counteract with it__. The next part is then having to *research* the problem online, with articles, videos, and stuff like that. I might also have to talk to other peers who are artists too, to get more opinions about AI art.

## Skills
Some skills I have developed while trying to decide on my topic were __How to Google Properly__ and __Being Focused__.

#### How to Google Properly
While I was busy googling for my topics of choice, I ended up realizing that I needed to be a bit more specific on what I say on Gooogle, so I just went with searches like *technology in art*, and *what type of technology is used in art*, for example. This helped me a lot with my research, as I managed to get the information I needed for the Freedom Project, and I ended learning a lot more than I expected, which was great! Now I know how I can look for what I want in Google for anything, you just need to be more **specific**.

#### Being Focused
While trying to look for articles and websites about the correlation between art and technology, it was easy to get distracted by everything else in the subject besides technology, and to fall in a rabbit hole in that instead. I can get distracted easily by other things to be honest, but I pulled through and managed to get enough research to finalize my major topic I wanted to do for the Freedom Project. So thanks to research, I managed to be more **focused** on what I'm supposed to do now.

## In the Future
I'm now going to look forward on researching futher more about the arts in our Freedom Project!
