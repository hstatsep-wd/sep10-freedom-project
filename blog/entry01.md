## Choosing a topic

im writing about the archival and preservation of infomation because it is important to me that human knowledge can be preserved and can be learned from by our future generations. my backup idea was cooking and combating the theft of peoples work. some links i have about these topics were:

## engineering design process
i currently locked on the preservation of infomation, and im on the first stage trying to find the problem and then to find a soloution. im thinking about trying to solve the problem of means of protecting infomation if something were to happen to an archive of infomation. for example, the internet archive is being attacked as i write this. i will discuss with my other peers to find a solution.

## skills
i have skills in programming and other things like engineering, and other non tech related things like jiu jitsu and tennis.

#### Time management
i am doing some things outside of school like tutoring elementry shcool kids, weight lifting, volunteering in events, and i have been doing a program from cooper union.

#### How to Google
i tried to skim some infomation on the web about the preservation of technology, sadly as i am writing this, the main resource that is the internet archive is not accessable.

## Next steps
i really cant wait to work on this project more!
