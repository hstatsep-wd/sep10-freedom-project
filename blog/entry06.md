## Making the Freedom Project Website
At the time of this blog, we *finally*, after much prepping and research, got to be able to work on making our Freedom Project Website. We had to work on it over the break, using all the skills we learned from this year into this major project. It was **definitely** a ride.

### Achieving MVP
To actually complete the project, we have to make an MVP to achieve our goals for our wesite. My MVP is basically getting all my information into the website, plus adding my tool jQuery and css. I ended up working a lot more on it than I thought, both in class and during the break, and I got a lot done. I ended up finishing my MVP as a result, and the final product ended up looking good in my opinion!
