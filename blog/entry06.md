## Making the Freedom Project Website
At the time of this blog, we *finally*, after much prepping and research, got to be able to work on making our Freedom Project Website. We had to work on it over the break, using all the skills we learned from this year into this major project. It was **definitely** a ride.

### Working on MVP
To actually complete the project, we have to make an MVP to achieve our goals for our website. My MVP is basically my timeline on working on the project. I first wanted to actually finish my wireframe, as it helps me get a basic idea of what I want my website to look like. I also planned to get a template, as it was the easier way to start my website rather than doing everything from scratch. Of course, I had to add on my tool, which is jQuery, and some CSS, as it's required to use jQuery, plus adding CSS makes the website much more **cooler**. 

By the time I decided my MVP, I was basically done with my wireframe, as I got everything I needed down, and I was ready to code my website. I was pretty excited, as I finally got to start making this website, and I can get it over with in just a few days. Or well, I *thought* I would finish in a few days. Turns out, making a website can be a **long** process...

### Achieving MVP
There were a lot of challenges in making the website, like adjusting the template to fit my vision of a website, as it was slightly different from my wireframe. Plus, due to it being a template, it had a lot of spare code left, like hundreds of lines of html, and thousands of lines of CSS! 

I ended up working a lot more on it than I thought, both in class and during the break, and I got a lot done. I ended up finishing my MVP as a result, and the final product ended up looking good in my opinion! Here is the [link](https://simrans4258.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) to the website!

## EDP
Currently, I am on step 4 of the Engineering Design Process, which is planning the most promising solution for our process. It took me a while for me to actually move onto this step, but it was worth it. You can also say that I'm on step 5, which is creating a prototype, which you can argue **is** the Freedom Project Website itself. Anyways, we still have a long way to go!

## Skills
Of course, when you do things like these, you are *bound* to learn a lot of skills along the way. Here are some I learned while making my Freedom Project Website.

### Patience
the first skill I learned was to have patience while making my website. Considering we had to make a website all by ourselves from basic scratch, it of course, took some time to complete for all of us, including myself. 

### Independance
Another skill I learned was independance, as this project we complete on our own, and I ended up learning how to do a lot of things by myself, at least, in doing webdesign. 

## What Comes Next
Well, next we have to work a bit more on our Freedom Project, and we are basically done from there! There is only one more month left of school by the time I'm writing this, so I can't wait!
