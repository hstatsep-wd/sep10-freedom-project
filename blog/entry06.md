## Making the Freedom Project Website
At the time of this blog, we *finally*, after much prepping and research, got to be able to work on making our Freedom Project Website. We had to work on it over the break, using all the skills we learned from this year into this major project. It was **definitely** a ride.

### Working on MVP
To actually complete the project, we have to make an MVP to achieve our goals for our website. My MVP is basically my timeline on working on the project. I first wanted to actually finish my wireframe, as it helps me get a basic idea of what I want my website to look like. I also planned to get a template, as it was the easier way to start my website rather than doing everything from scratch. Of course, I had to add on my tool, which is jQuery, and some CSS, as it's required to use jQuery, plus adding CSS makes the website much more **cooler**. 

By the time I decided my MVP, I was basically done with my wireframe, as I got everything I needed down, and I was ready to code my website. I was pretty excited, as I finally got to start making this website, and I can get it over with in just a few days. Or well, I *thought* I would finish in a few days. Turns out, making a website can be a **long** process...

### Achieving MVP
I ended up working a lot more on it than I thought, both in class and during the break, and I got a lot done. I ended up finishing my MVP as a result, and the final product ended up looking good in my opinion!
