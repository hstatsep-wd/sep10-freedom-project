## Making the Freedom Project Website
At the time of this blog, we *finally*, after much prepping and research, got to be able to work on making our Freedom Project Website. We had to work on it over the break, using all the skills we learned from this year into this major project. It was **definitely** a ride.

### Working on MVP
To actually complete the project, we have to make an MVP to achieve our goals for our website. My MVP is basically my timeline on working on the project. I first wanted to actually finish my wireframe, as it helps me get a basic idea of what I want my website to look like. I also planned to get a template, as it was the easier way to start my website rather than doing everything from scratch. Of course, I had to add on my tool, which is jQuery, and some CSS, as it's required to use jQuery, plus adding CSS makes the website much more **cooler**. 

By the time I decided my MVP, I was basically done with my wireframe, as I got everything I needed down, and I was ready to code my website. I was pretty excited, as I finally got to start making this website, and I can get it over with in just a few days. Or well, I *thought* I would finish in a few days. Turns out, making a website can be a **long** process...

### Achieving MVP
There were a lot of challenges in making the website, like adjusting the template to fit my vision of a website, as it was slightly different from my wireframe. Plus, due to it being a template, it had a lot of spare code left, like hundreds of lines of html, and **thousands** of lines of CSS! Plus, there were **a lot** of classes that I didn't know of. So, I ended up having to adjust way **more** to the code than I expected. So, I did what I had to do, and ended up having to ignore and add more lines of CSS and html in order to fit with my website, which was fine. So, I ended up with code like this:
```html
  <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold text-center p-3">Art</h1>
  <div class="container px-lg-5">
      <div class="p-4 rounded-3 text-center">
          <div class="m-4 m-lg-5">
              <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold" id="context">Context</h1>
              <p class="fs-4">...</p>
          </div>
      </div>
  </div>
```

I ended up working a lot more on it than I thought, both in class and during the break, and I got a lot done. II ended up finishing my MVP as a result, and while I had to adjust some things in order for the website to actually look nice, the final product ended up looking good in my opinion!

## EDP
Currently, I am on step 4 of the Engineering Design Process, which is planning the most promising solution for our process. It took me a while for me to actually move onto this step, but it was worth it. You can also say that I'm on step 5, which is creating a prototype, which you can argue **is** the Freedom Project Website itself. Anyways, we still have a long way to go!

## Skills
Of course, when you do things like these, you are *bound* to learn a lot of skills along the way. Here are some I learned while making my Freedom Project Website.

### Patience
The first skill I learned was to have patience while making my website. Considering we had to make a website all by ourselves from basic scratch, it of course, took some time to complete for all of us, including myself. It ended up taking me the entire spring break, plus some school days, for me to actually complete the project in time. Of course, I took some days off of making the website, but I ended up completing it in time. And of course, I ended up having to fix a lot of problems I saw in my code, like the *abundance* of lines of CSS, so I had to do some adjustments to ignore all of that. I also had a hard time actually previewing my code on the actual website page, as it takes *a long time* for things to load on the actual website, for some reason. I was a bit worried at first, but then it worked, so all was good. Thanks to this, now I know that sometimes, things take time. Even if it seems frustrating to keep up with, it'll be worth it at the end.

### Independance
Another skill I learned was independance, as this project we complete on our own, and I ended up learning how to do a lot of things by myself, at least, in doing webdesign. Due to working on most of my project at home, I had to solve a lot of problems in my code on my own. For example, I was wondering why my cards were seemingly so compacted, but since I was at home, being the only person with experience in coding, I had to do it myself. I at first wanted to ask help from my friends, but then I realized the problem with my code, as I realized that I added too many columns, which made it compacted. I had ease with the project later on, and I felt **more** confident in myself the more I coded. Thanks to working on it by myself, I ended up getting more confident in myself in web design, which I'm grateful for.

## What Comes Next
Well, next we have to work a bit more on our Freedom Project, and we are basically done from there! There is only one more month left of school by the time I'm writing this, so I can't wait!
